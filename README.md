# Single Cell Immune Profiling of Atherosclerotic Plaques
This repository contains notebooks for interactively visualizing the single cell gene expression data from the study: **Immune Profiling of Atherosclerotic Plaques Identifies Innate and Adaptive  Dysregulations Associated with Ischemic Cerebrovascular Events (Fernandez et al.)**. The interactive visualizations are made using the single cell data analysis and visualization toolkit [Clustergrammer2](https://github.com/ismms-himc/clustergrammer2).

Single cell antibody derived tag data data was obtained from plaque and PBMC from the same subject. Cell type was assigned based on ADT surface marker expression.
