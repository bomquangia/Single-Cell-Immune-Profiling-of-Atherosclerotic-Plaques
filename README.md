# Single Cell Immune Profiling of Atherosclerotic Plaques
This repository contains notebooks for interactively visualizing the single cell gene expression data from the study: **Immune Profiling of Atherosclerotic Plaques Identifies Innate and Adaptive  Dysregulations Associated with Ischemic Cerebrovascular Events (Fernandez et al.)**. The interactive visualizations are made using the single cell data analysis and visualization toolkit [Clustergrammer2](https://github.com/ismms-himc/clustergrammer2).
